# DATA512 Project Part 1

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to collaborate with my peers to analyze Covid-19 data as well as mask mandate data to answer the question How did masking policies change the progression of confirmed COVID-19 cases from February 1, 2020 through October 1, 2021?

## Project Description
For this project we use Covid-19 Cases data from Johns-Hopkins, CDC data about mask mandates and data from the New York Times mask compliance survey to create visualizations to analyze how masking policies changed the progression of confirmed COVID-19 cases
