# Visualization Explanation
 ![Graph1](covid_rates.png)
 
 The above graph visualizes the rate of covid over time in Philadelphia, PA. The 'rate' of covid is calculated by taking the gradient of the number of cases over time to find the rate of change. The x-axis displays the dates from early 2020 to summer 2022. The y-axis displays the rate of change of covid. The colors shows whether there was a mask mandate at the time. Red indicates that there was no mask mandated and blue indicates there was a mask mandate during the time. We found whether there was a mask mandate or not by joining the covid cases data with the mask mandate data by the date. If there was no value available for the mask mandate it was just set as 'No'. The black lines indicate the change points. The national library of medicine defines change points as the "abrupt variations in time series data. Such abrupt changes may represent transitions that occur between states."

 This graph is very similar to the first graph. We visualize the number of covid cases over time in Philadelphia. This data is from the John Hopkins University Covid-19 Data. The x-axis displays the dates from early 2020 to summer 2022. The y-axis displays the number of covid cases per day in Philadelphia, PA.The colors shows whether there was a mask mandate at the time. Red indicates that there was no mask mandated and blue indicates there was a mask mandate during the time. We found whether there was a mask mandate or not by joining the covid cases data with the mask mandate data by the date. If there was no value available for the mask mandate it was just set as 'No'.
